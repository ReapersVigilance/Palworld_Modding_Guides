# Overview

This guide is to show how to setup your model with UE's compatible skeletons to activate Kawaii physics and collision. **FOR CUSTOM ADDED BONES** 
####
I am assuming you understand the concept and setup of model swapping including the extraction from FModel, Importing to Blender, Weight painting, and Export from Blender. I will touch on them briefly however.
Other guides are quite detailed in doing all of the above.

I'm going to Write this as a full Model Swap however it can be done with just Hair/Head Models as long as you use a dummy SK_PalHuman_Skeleton in the proper folder.

process is very similar to a normal model swap except for some key differences in the Exporting from blender and UE work.


## Critical Notes
- This method works for adding physics to **CUSTOM BONES** in both Hair and Head Swaps. It does **NOT** work for adding physics bones to Outfit swaps. (Unless you like T-posing everywhere)So it works best doing them all together and choosing which Kawaii parts will be Hair and which will be Head.
- As long as you're adding physics to Default Bones on an Outfit, that'll work without the Compatible Skeletons. Can skip right to the Kawaii section for that.
####
This is absolutely not a replacement for the bone reorder and animation tool by **`Shifty`**
It just allows you to add physics to swaps without breaking the animations.

Can be used in combination with Jiggle Physics (18+) guide by **`Dytser`**


## Tools Needed

- FModel
- Blender
- UE 5.1
- Kawaii Physics plugin 1.10
- UnrealPak

# Full Process

## Step 1 _ (FModel and Blender) - `File Prep`
- Standard Model Swap process to begin
    - The Psk you will need to Export from FModel is the `SK_Player_Female` from the path `Pal/Content/Pal/Model/Character/Player/Body/Female` this comes with the SK_PalHuman_Skeleton we need
      - can be done with one of the outfit skeletons as well as they reference the same.
- Import this psk into blender along with the model you will be swapping.   **`SEE IMAGE 01`**
- From here is the same as a normal model swap with aligning your model and applying your model to the game skeleton.

## Step 2 _ (Blender) - `Add Bones and Painting`
- You can now add bones to the skeleton that will reference any part you want Kawaii Physics
    - Hair, Tail, Ears, Dangling parts, Whatever
    - Have the last bone of these parts off of the model. It helps for the physics later.  **`SEE IMAGE 02`**
    - ENSURE THESE BONES ATTACH TO OTHER BONES 
        - Example: parent the first bone of a hair chain to the head bone,  
            or parent the first tail bone to the spine_01 bone.
- Weight paint. 
    - Whether you do it manually or use Mesh Data Transfer from the original game model.   
        Tweak as necessary for your new bones.
     - That last bone thats slightly hanging off will need to influence the very tip of whatever part its attached it.

- There is an in game bug regarding Mounted Combat that needs to be worked around at this point or it will affect everything from here on. **`SEE IMAGE 18`**
    - Any Custom added bones Above the Waist will error when aiming side to side while mounted. This has something to do with the animation lock of the root bone.
    - To Fix. all above waist added bones must use names of existing in game bones that are not being used by the Outfit Swap. 
        - All the Hair bones can be used to fix this **`SEE IMAGE 19`**
    - This bug persists on anything with applied physics even if not using Kawaii. ie. spring controllers for jiggle physics
        - I recommend repurposing the backpack bones as weight paint for breasts

## Step 3 _ (Blender) - `Dividing up the Model`
- You now need to split your model into the Necessary Parts that are going to be your *Outfit Swap*, *Head Swap*, and *Hair Swap*.
    - For my exaple the Ears are a *Hair Swap*, The Tail and Back spikes are a *Head Swap*, and Everything else is an *Outfit Swap* 
    - Keep in mind that some helmets overwrite the hair, so if you dont want your *Hair Swap* to disappear in those instances you can combine the *Hair Swap* and *Head Swap* into just a *Head Swap*.
- Keep in mind you only need to separate the meshes but everything can stay attached to the same Armature **`SEE IMAGES 03, 04, and 05`**
    - I added small spheres onto the connection bone as i occasionally had a bone error on importing to UE but it was not consistent. Those spheres stopped it completely.
- Export these as 3 separate FBX files with the armature in each one. just like the images.

## Step 4 _ (UE) - `Import Setup`
- UE folder setup is the same as any normal model swap as well as all your cooking settings  **`SEE IMAGE 06`**
     - I am only doing an *Outfit Swap* of the Old Cloth in this example, If you're doing other outfits then you'll need those too.
     - note that the *Hair Swap* and *Head Swap* can be done with any head and hair, not just 001 as i am showing here

## Step 5 _ (UE) - `Import Outfit FBX`
- Standard model swap applies here
- Import your FBX into the folder `SK_Player_Female_Outfit_OldCloth001`
    - Rename `Skeleton` to `SK_PalHuman_Skeleton`, and move to the Human Folder  **`SEE IMAGE 07`**
    - Rename `Physics Asset` to `SK_Player_Female_PhysicsAsset`, and move to the Female Folder  **`SEE IMAGE 08`**
     - Rename `Skeletal Mesh` to `SK_Player_Female_Outfit_OldCloth001`  **`SEE IMAGE 09`**
- Renaming materials and Textures is up to you, or may depend on what kind of swap you are doing
- If you have more outfits, rename and relink skeleton and physics asset as necessary.

####

- Optional set up of `Kawaii Collision Asset`
  - Right click on the `Skeletal Mesh` and Create an `Animation Blueprint`
    - You may already have one if jiggle physics are enabled
  - Use this model to create the `Collision Asset` as you can see all collidable entities
    - I wont go into detail on this as its quite involved but I will link a very informative Video at the end of this for how to do it. 
       - Experiment with your Collision objects as you need.
   - If you dont set up the `Collision Asset` the physics will still work, they just may clip with your model

## Step 6 _ (UE) - `Import Hair FBX`
- Import your FBX into the folder Hair001
    - Rename `Skeletal Mesh` to `SK_Player_Hair001`
- Renaming anything else is up to you
- Right click on the `Skeletal Mesh` and Create an `Animation Blueprint`
- Open the `Physics Asset` that was auto generated upon import
    - We dont need anything here as it will be controlled by Kawaii
        - Delete everything under the skeleton tree
        - Save and Close  
            *Possible that setting this up further will add collision between the hair and the world around,* ***needs more testing***
- Open the `Skeletal Mesh`
    - under the `Asset Details` Tab, Scroll down until you find the `Post Process Anim Blueprint` and set it to the one you just Created  **`SEE IMAGE 10`**
- Open the `Skeleton`
    - Under the `Asset Details` Tab, Add a `Compatible Skeleton` and set it to the `SK_PalHuman_Skeleton` from the *Outfit FBX*  **`SEE IMAGE 11`**
        - **IMPORTANT** This tab might be hidden by default for you, click on Window on the top bar to turn it on
- Open the `Animation Blueprint`
     - Set up your Kawaii physics and Collision. **`SEE IMAGE 12`**
        - I wont go into detail on this as its quite involved but I will link a very informative Video at the end of this for how to do it. 
            - Experiment with your settings as you need.

- Import your FBX into the folder Head001
    - Rename `Skeletal Mesh` to `SK_Player_Female_Head001`
- Renaming anything else is up to you
- Right click on the `Skeletal Mesh` and Create an `Animation Blueprint`

## Step 8 - Finishing Touches
- From here most everything is the same as a normal model swap so i will only go over it quickly and call attention to things that need it
  - Cook like normal
  - Copy into your Pak file structure and remove the `skeleton` in the Human folder, and the `Physics asset` in the Female Folder
     - **CRITICAL** The skeleton and assets in the Head001 folder and Hair001 folder must **STAY** in the Pak
  - Use UnrealPak to make your Pak file
  - Drop into your game files

## Step 9 - Finish
- Enjoy a model swap with Kawaii Physics and Collision. Thats it
